Flatgames

    brought to you by Nial Johnson, Farhan Hossain, and Michael Vela

 This design that we are building is a hub for the gaming community or anyone who is interested with being apart of the gaming world! 
 This hub will consist of different games that users play with their thoughts on it as well. If there is a game that you have played, you have to option to share your thought on it as well with the comment feature. If by chance you don't see a game that you play then you will have the option to post a game and share with the world!
