Flatgames


brought to you by Nial Johnson, Farhan Hossain, and Michael Vela


This design that we are building is a hub for the gaming community or anyone who is interested in being a part of the gaming world!
This hub will consist of different games that users play with their personalized description on it as well. When uploading we have the chance to give it a rating as well. If by chance you don't see a game that you play then you will have the option to post a game and share with the world!




Deliverables
1. Having a list of games that include information such as genre, title, developers, along with a description from the person that uploads it. (Giving it a rating as well)


2. Users will be able to click on games that are in the list and have it display where it shows at the top.


3. Users will be able to add another game that saves to the database, using the information in the form.


EXTRA DELIVERABLES
1. Being able to filter through the games based on the genes of games.


3. Giving people the space to add their username and platform that they play on(making it more interactive)
